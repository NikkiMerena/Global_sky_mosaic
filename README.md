# Global Sky Mosaic

It fetches data from the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and displays the temperature,weather description and for the selected campus and current picture of the campus. Our goal is to bring the beauty of the Holberton skies from the different campuses to bring a sense of community!
